# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a single-page Twitter clone created as part of an exercise at LHL bootcamp to expand my abilities with front-end development. The app implements AJAX, jQuery, html, Javascript, and css to maintain a content feed that updates automatically with posts. Tweeter runs on a simple express server and uses MongoDB for persistent data storage.

Tweeter currently takes in posts and assigns them to a randomly generated user.
